# Stronghold-Crusader-efficient-AI
tldr: 8 more efficient and consistant castles for all AI characters in the game Stronghold Crusader balanced for 2k startgold and aggressive aic

This project aims for creating a complete castle set for all 16 characters found in the vanilla game. The so created castles shall be compativble with the vanilla base game but also compatible with Krarilotus-aggressiveAI which is a modificiation of the base characteristic for every character of the game.
The goals for the castle designs are:
- very efficient build oder
- reduced amount of buildsteps
- fast setup time for the AI
- low costs
- size about the same as the vanilla castles, only moat and unimportant structures could reach further out
-> compatibility for the skimish trail of the base games
- 8 castles for each character with all the exact same amount of buildsteps and almost equal buildorder

# Stage 1: Prototyping
In this stage, we create one prototype castle for each AI and document its buildorder.
After creating a base concept idea for a castle for each character, we perfect their buildorder with 2k startgold as a base setup. We messure the timing of the first attack with the newest aggressive aic provided by Krarilotus on high, average and low ressource map with low and high pressure by enemy attacks, aswell as initial and later defense against enemy attacks.

Prototypes completion right now:

finished:
- rat

almost finished:
- snake
- pig
- frederick
- emir
- marshal
- wazir

concept finished:
- wolf
- saladin
- caliph
- richard
- sultan

in design:
- nizar
- phillip

still missing:
- sheriff
- abbot

# Stage 2: Diversification
In this stage, we will create 7 more castles for each AI, that have the same buildorder and the same amount of buildsteps.
Goal here is, to have a castle fitting for each kind of map space limitation possible. That way the characters will more likely build their essential economical buildings like market, granary, and troop production buildings, even if the terrain is narrow and tight.

Current project stage: Prototyping.

You can find the newest aggressive aic made by Krarilotus in the repository.

The buildorder documentation can be found here:

This is not up to date, as we will update the buildorders and documentation for each AI after the prototyping has been finished.
